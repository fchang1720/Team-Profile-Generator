# Team-Profile-Generator

For this project, I created an application that uses node JS to take in information about employees. After input about the employees is stored, an HTML website is then generated that displays all employees and their collected information. The application uses the NPMs inquirer and jest to help collect and test developer inputs. 

You can watch a walkthrough video of my application here:
